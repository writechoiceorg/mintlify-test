<Update label="Anaconda 5.0.0.1 (Oct 02, 2017)" description="">
    * Fixes Python & C compiler fallback path for all cases on x86/x86\_64 Linux. Without this fix, people were required to use our new compilers, which is not something we want to enforce at this time. This was affecting travis-ci builds and pip installs of packages that require compilation for extensions.
