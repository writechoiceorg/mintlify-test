<Update label="Anaconda 4.3.0.1 (Feb 03, 2017)" description="">
    In this “mirco” patch release, we fixed a problem with the Windows
    installers which was causing problems with Qt applications when the
    install prefix exceeds 30 characters. No new Anaconda meta-packages
    correspond to this release (only new Windows installers).
