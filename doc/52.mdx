<Update label="Anaconda 1.6.0 (Jun 21, 2013)" description="">
    Highlights:
    
    * the “Launcher”, which allows users to start up applications
    * conda has now the ability to build conda packages, which can be
      uploaded to binstar.org
    * conda now uses a SAT solver to solve the install dependency problem
    
    Enhancements:
    
    * added a .pkg installer for macOS, such that installing Anaconda does
      not require command line access
    * create copy of .bashrc (.bash\_profile on macOS) before appending the PATH
      setting upon install
    * Windows Menu items should are now installed system wide
    
    Fixes:
    
    * removed Lib/test/testbz2\_bigmem.bz2 from Windows, this (harmless) file
      was triggering Trojan-ArcBomb.BZip.Agent warning, see:
      `<http://bugs.python.org/issue17843>`
    * json.decoder in Python 2.7 standard library not using .decode(‘hex’),
      this was (mysteriously) causing install problems on macOS
    * fixed PIL.\_imagetk on Linux
    
    Updated:
    
    * python from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5, and 3.3.1 to 3.3.2
    * conda from 1.5.2 to 1.7.1
    * numba from 0.8.1 to 0.9.0
    * requests from 1.2.0 to 1.2.3
    
    Added:
    
    * launcher 0.1.1
    * binstar 0.1.1
    * itsdangerous 0.21
    * keyring 1.4
    * llvmmath 0.1.0
    * pep8 1.4.5
    * pywin32 218.4 on Windows
