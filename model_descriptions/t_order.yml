    description: > 
      An order is a record of a request for a set of diagnostic investigations to be performed. The investigation will lead to a diagnostic report that summarizes the outcome of the investigation, and includes contextual data about the ordering workflow which at a minimum should the date the order was generated and the date the result was reviewed.  The general work flow that this resource facilitates is: (1) A clinical system creates a diagnostic order. (2) The diagnostic order is then exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that represents a diagnostic service that can perform the investigation as a request to do so. (3) The diagnostic service will update the request as the work is performed, and (4) then issues a report that references the requests that it fulfills.  Several types of orders are currently supported in this entity: Procedures, such as an order for a mammogram or colonoscopy, referrals, such as a primary care physician ordering a referral to a specialist, and labs, such as an A1c test for a diabetic patient.
