        This table contains the master list of data sources. Data sources can be physically separate sources (e.g. 'Commercial Claims Feed', 'Medicare CCLF Feed') or they can be logically separated sources (e.g. 'Pod A','Pod B'). Source IDs are used throughout all other table definitions.

    columns:
      - name: source_id
        description: >
          QDW plan source ID; primary key for this table.  This is generated by Arcadia.
          Note that 'sources' in the plan tables are analogous to 'sites' in the clinical
          tables.
      - name: orig_source_id
        description: >
          ID of the plan source row in the Staging database, used to tie back to the plan
          data source.  This is created by the connector query or direct feed that loads
          the row from a given source, and is derived from plan data source column(s) to
          uniquely identify a row. For a given source, one original ID corresponds to one
          and only one QDW ID for this entity.  The same original ID value could be found
          on more than one row if the rows are derived from different sources.
      - name: source_desc
        description: >
          Name of the plan data source.  This name is visible in the Arcadia Analytics
          front end in several reports.  Because this is visible to users, it is best if
          this name is brief (max 35 chars), easy to read, and distinct from the values
          for other sources.
      - name: source_type
        description: >
          Type of source system.  There is no set of valid values for this column.  Values
          are set according to any distinctions that are useful to the client, and in some
          client databases are always null.
      - name: insert_timestamp
        description: >
          Date and time when the row was first inserted into the QDW.
      - name: update_timestamp
        description: >
          Date and time when the row was last updated in the QDW.
      - name: create_timestamp
        description: >
          Date and time when the row was first inserted into the plan data source.
      - name: modify_timestamp
        description: >
          Date and time when the row was last updated in the plan data source.
      - name: created_by
        description: >
          User who first inserted the row into the plan data source, as specified by a
          user ID known to the plan data source.
      - name: modified_by
        description: >
          User who most recently updated the row in the plan data source, as specified by
          a user ID known to the plan data source.
      - name: delete_ind
        description: >
          Indicates if the record is marked as deleted, either because it was deleted in
          the plan data source, or because the connector query changed in a way that makes
          the record no longer valid.  Values are 'Y' (deleted) and 'N' (not
          deleted).  If the value is 'Y' then the row should be excluded from all queries.
      - name: loaded_from_file
        description: >
          Name of the file from which this particular record was first loaded, usually a
          CSV file. The following pieces of information may be embedded in this file name:
          date and time of the extract, client and source IDs, and connector query
          version.
      - name: source_display_name
        description: >
          Name of the plan data source.  If non-null, this name is visible in the Arcadia
          Analytics front end in several reports.  Because this is visible to users, it is
          best if this name is brief (max 35 chars), easy to read, and distinct from the
          values for other sources.
