    description: > 
      An assessment is a diagnosis identified at the close of an encounter (provider-patient interaction) that is relevant to that encounter and that includes complaints or reasons for medical attention. All assessments must be coded to a national code set for classification and should represent the provider's objective determination as to the justifications for procedures for that encounter.
