           ID of the plan provider contract row in the Staging database, used to tie back to the plan data source.  This is created by the connector query or direct feed that loads the row from a given source, and is derived from plan data source column(s) to uniquely identify a row. For a given source, one original ID corresponds to one and only one QDW ID for this entity.  The same original ID value could be found on more than one row if the rows are derived from different sources.

      description: >
           QDW source ID of the plan data source from which this record was obtained.
    - name: insert_timestamp
      description: >
           Date and time when the row was first inserted into the QDW.

      description: >
           Date and time when the row was last updated in the QDW.
    - name: create_timestamp
      description: >
           Date and time when the row was first inserted into the plan data source.
    - name: modify_timestamp

      description: >
           User who most recently updated the row in the plan data source, as specified by a user ID known to the plan data source.
    - name: update_process

    - name: delete_ind
      description: >
           Indicates if the record is marked as deleted, either because it was deleted in the plan data source, or because the connector query changed in a way that makes the record no longer valid.  Values are ï¿½Yï¿½ (deleted) and ï¿½Nï¿½ (not deleted).  If the value is 'Y' then the row should be excluded from all queries.
    - name: loaded_from_file
      description: >
           Name of the file from which this particular record was first loaded, usually a CSV file. The following pieces of information may be embedded in this file name: date and time of the extract, client and source IDs, and connector query version.
