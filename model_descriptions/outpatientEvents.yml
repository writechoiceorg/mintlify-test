      All Outpatient activity is represented here, with claim lines rolled-up according to Arcadia’s hierarchical report
      grouper. As [inpatientEvents] assigns all costs and determines primary codes per Inpatient Stay, [outpatientEvents]
      lists one record per utpatient “ vent” and rolls up claim line details into that single event row. he definition of an
      outpatient “event” varies. or e ample an bservation tay is considered a single event and all activities within the
      stay are combined into that event record. A Radiology event, however, is only the costs/details of claims with the
      related radiology procedure code. More details on the hierarchical event logic can be found in the Event Grouper and
