  - name: web_CustomReports
    description: >
      A list of all generic columns (like IntCol1, IntCol2, StringCol1, etc) used by each custom report.
      A map of generic column names to the actual names we want to show on the UI for those columns.
      Should include a row for each column in each custom report.

    columns:
      - name: ReportName
        description: >
          Report display name in UI.
      - name: GenericColumnName
        description: >
          The name of the corresponding column in CustomReportData table.
      - name: ColumnDisplayName
        description: >
          Should reference the data type.
          e.g. Outpatient$Count__int, ED$Count__int', npatient$Count__int.
          Fields will be turned into display names using the following rules:
            _ will be a space
            $ will be a new line
            _Ind fields used for conditional formatting
            __int will be displayed as Number with no decimals (return data type int)
            __cur will be displayed as $ with no decimals (return data type int)
            __flt will be displayed as Number with 1 decimals (return data type numeric(18,1)
            __flt2 will be displayed as Number with 2 decimals (return data type numeric(18,2)
            __pct will be displayed as Pct with no decimals e.g. 70% or .70 (return data type numeric(18,2)
            __pct2 will be displayed as Pct with 2 decimals e.g. 70.00% or .7000 (return data type numeric(18,4)
            __dt will be displayed as a date (data type date)
            patinfo- prefix will be hidden by default
            patient_name to be clickable needs to have the title "Name"
            Note: '.' is a safe character
          
          If the above naming convention is not followed for declaring column types, those columns will be treated
          as string data, and will not be filterable.
