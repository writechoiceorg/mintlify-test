      Note: This information is also on the [eventLineDetails] table and IP/OP events can be cross-walked directly. As Arcadia 'Events' can summarize multiple claim lines, this table holds a one-to-many crosswalk between an Arcadia rollup event ID (from [inpatientEvents] and [outpatientEvents]) and the corresponding detailed ID from [eventLineDetails]. Use this to find all corresponding claims for a given event. 
    columns:
      - name: detailEventId
        description: >
          The Arcadia internal ID of the line-level event included
          in the roll-up. Join to [dbo].[eventLineDetails] for the
          individual line details. This identifier is subject to
          change over time.
      - name: rollupEventId
        description: >
          The Arcadia internal ID of the IP or OP event after rollup.
          Join to [dbo].[inpatientEvents] or
          [dbo].[outpatientEvents] for the rolled up event
          record. This identifier is subject to change over time.
      - name: triggerInd
        description: >
          A 0/1 indicator for whether the detail event was the
          trigger line for either inpatient or outpatient event
          rollup.
