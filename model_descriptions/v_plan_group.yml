      - name: orig_group_id
        description: >
            ID of the group row in the Staging database, used to tie back to the plan data source.  This is created by the connector query or direct feed that loads the row from a given source, and is derived from plan data source column(s) to uniquely identify a row. For a given source, one original ID corresponds to one and only one QDW ID for this entity.  The same original ID value could be found on more than one row if the rows are derived from different sources.

      - name: end_date
        description: >
            Group end date.  This value is non-null only when the group is relevant or in place for a defined period of time.
      - name: insert_timestamp
        description: >

      - name: modified_by
        description: >
            User who most recently updated the row in the plan data source, as specified by a user ID known to the plan data source.
      - name: delete_ind
        description: >
            Indicates if the record is marked as deleted, either because it was deleted in the plan data source, or because the connector query changed in a way that makes the record no longer valid.  Values are Y (deleted) and N (not deleted).  If the value is 'Y' then the row should be excluded from all queries.
      - name: loaded_from_file
        description: >
            Name of the file from which this particular record was first loaded, usually a CSV file. The following pieces of information may be embedded in this file name: date and time of the extract, client and source IDs, and connector query version.
