      Contain the results of all quality measures enabled in Analytics. The [personMeasures] view
      contains one record per person/period/measure for the entire population, while the [personMeasuresContract] table
      contains one record per person/payer/measure for each year period in which a person was enrolled with a plan.
      ote the “person” is the post-MPI record, so it is possible that these results contain data from multiple member
      records (duals or churn) and multiple patient records (specialty/hospital and primary care) per person. Note the
      Denominator and Numerator fields contain more detailed breakouts, with Exclusions and Exceptions called out
      separately
