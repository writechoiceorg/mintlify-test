          "description": "This column is critical in highlighting what has a high (or low) probability of being a match. This uses the Levenshtein distance function (Levenshtein reference link) to see differences between key fields (last name, first name member number, phone, zip, and DOB). Ex. Jane Doe and Jane Smith could have the same DOB, different phone numbers, and different addresses. This would result in a low comapreRank, however, one record could be 5 years old, and she has since married which could explain the last name/phone/address changes. The calculation will sum up all the Levenshtein distance outputs from the first name, last name, zip, and DOB. There are a couple of nuances to the calculationsâ€¦ If the member numbers match exactly, the compareRank automatically returns a 0 (aka max probability). If the phone numbers match exactly, it will divide the summed-up compareRank in half. General guideline on how to use the report: Most results are going to have compareRanks greater than ~5. Anything above this number can be viewed as having low confidence of being a potential merge; however, they're included within the report given they've met *some* criteria based on the configurations set.\n"
