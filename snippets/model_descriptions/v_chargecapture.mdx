The main information of interest on this table is the coded information about procedures.  A procedure is an activity that is performed with or on a patient as part of the provision of care in the documented encounter/interaction. This can be a physical intervention like an operation, or less invasive like counseling or hypnotherapy. The procedure entity should not be used to capture an event if a more specific resource already exists i.e. immunization.  All procedures should be encoded with SNOMED or HCPCS, and should include clinical context as to the site, performer and outcome of the procedure.    columns:\n",

Most charge capture records should be linked to encounters, and vice versa most encounters should be linked to charge capture records. This link is important because the logic for flagging encounters as 'medical' encounters is based on the CPT codes found on the linked charge capture records.  When an encounter can't be linked to a charge capture record, it is automatically flagged as a 'non-medical' encounter.    This link is also required for the procedure to be included in the pseudo claims extract.    Additionally, it is used for location filtering in Arcadia Analytics, because the location is derived from the associated encounter.\n"
