Although the universe of patient observations can be very large, the Arcadia Analytics platform has a focused set of observations that are of interest in developing metrics.   In a sense, this table is a catch-all location for structured non-coded data documented within EHR systems.  Typical items stored here include: 1)documentation of assessments or questionnaires performed by staff member within a visit: i.e. Depression Screen PHQ Questions, Medication Reconciliation, Review of Systems, Nutrition Counseling, Physical Activity Counseling, 2)documentation of patient history or social status: i.e. Smoking Status, Surgical History, past screenings, 3)In-office procedures not otherwise coded: i.e. dressing changes wound check, injections, and 4)selected custom elements of the medical record as defined through client consultation. A good rule of thumb is that these observations are documentation of current or prior actions or knowledge that create a more complete record.\n",
