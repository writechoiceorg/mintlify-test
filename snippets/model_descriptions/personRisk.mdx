It contains one record per person/algorithm/model/year/evidence, meaning there will be at least one record reflecting every gap identified for each applicable model and for every source from which the risk element or gap was identified. It also contains an example “event” of each gap from each source, which can include the data source name, codes used, the date of the event, and the provider who rendered the service generating the record. The table surfaces both the raw risk value associated with the condition* and the final calculated risk value, indicating exactly which sources contribute to the final calculated risk value. (*ACG does not support condition-grain risk scores.)\n",
