Result observations should be encoded with LOINC or SNOMED codes and have numeric readings and units or findings and interpretation of diagnostic data_tests. Furthermore, results should include clinical context, such as requester and provider information, and some mix of atomic results, textual and coded interpretations, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.
