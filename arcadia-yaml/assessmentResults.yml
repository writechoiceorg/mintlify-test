    description: >
      This table displays results from submitted care assessment forms in a tabular format. There is one record per response result, so multi-select questions may have multiple records for the same question, and questions that were not answered may not appear in the table. Each result group is associated with a task in [cm].[userActivity] and with a single assessment version, the content of which can be referenced in [cm].[assessments].
